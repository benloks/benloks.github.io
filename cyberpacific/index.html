          <h2>About the conference</h2>
          <p class="lead">The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade of Australia (DFAT), The New Zealand Ministry for Foreign Affairs and Trade (MFAT), The Asia Foundation, and the APNIC Foundation will convene a 3.5-day virtual dialogue on Pacific regional cybersecurity governance on November 17-20, 2020.</p>
          <p>In the past five years, new undersea cable projects and other internet infrastructure improvements have begun connecting Pacific internet users to faster and more accessible digital resources. At the same time, greater connectivity has also brought new cybersecurity challenges for civil society, the private sector, and government. With small populations and limited resources, Pacific Island countries and territories rely on cooperation with regional and international stakeholders to understand and respond to these threats.</p>
          <p>Participants in the conference will share current activities and issues in their home economies, identify capacity-building needs, learn from peers and experts from within and outside of the region, and identify ways of bridging gaps between technical and policy communities on cybersecurity topics. The objective of the conference is to build a stronger and more sustainable basis for collaboration on cybersecurity implementation, policymaking, education, and governance within the Pacific.</p>
          <p>Over the course of the conference, participants will:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Identify areas of shared interest and responsibility between technical and policy communities on cybersecurity topics;</li>
            <li>Strengthen their own understanding of cybersecurity governance and the roles that multi-stakeholder institutions and fora can play in enabling cyber threat resilience;</li>
            <li>Participate in a tabletop exercise designed to highlight the strengths and weaknesses of the Pacific’s cyber capacity;</li>
            <li>Identify concrete next steps that will support sustainable, cross-cutting collaboration and continued cyber-development within the region.</li>
