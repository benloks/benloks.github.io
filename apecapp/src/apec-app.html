              <h3>About</h3>
              <h4>How can APEC’s software developers help micro &amp; small businesses grow?</h4>
              <p>During APEC in 2018, under the theme of “Harnessing Inclusive Opportunities, Embracing the Digital Future,” many high-level discussions will take place around the goal of improving the opportunities available to micro and small enterprises. Micro, small and medium-sized enterprise (MSMEs) make up roughly 98% of all businesses in the Asia-Pacific and employ two thirds of the region’s labor force, but account for only a small fraction of total exports and often struggle to expand to new markets. While online platforms for ecommerce and advertising have dramatically improved MSMEs' ability to integrate with global value chains and grow their businesses, many small-scale artisans and entrepreneurs in the Asia Pacific lack the tools or knowledge to take advantage of these opportunities. Women artisans and cooperatives - especially those in remote and rural areas - often face the greatest difficulties in accessing these opportunities. Participants in the 2018 APEC App Challenge will use their software development and design skills to help micro and small entrepreneurs access more online business opportunities and engage in expanded trade.</p>
